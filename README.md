## Overview

This repository implements novel topological data analysis (TDA) methods for detecting anomalies in time-varying cryptocurrency transaction networks. We introduce three velocity-based persistence diagram summaries:

- **HNAV** (Hierarchical Normalized Averaged Velocity): Unweighted velocity-based summary
- **HWNAV** (Hierarchical Weighted Normalized Averaged Velocity): Persistence-weighted velocity summary
- **OW-HNPV** (Overlap-Weighted Hierarchical Normalized Persistence Velocity): Our main contribution with overlap-based weighting

These methods are compared against established TDA summaries:
- **VAB** (Vector of Averaged Bettis)
- **PL** (Persistence Landscapes)
- **PI** (Persistence Images)
